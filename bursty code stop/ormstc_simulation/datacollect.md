# ORMSTC Data Collection — Column Reference & Configuration Details

This document provides a detailed explanation of all configuration parameters and **column names** generated by the `data_collection.py` script.

## ⚙️ Test Configurations

| Parameter | 16×16 Grid | 50×50 Grid |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| **Grid size** | 16 × 16 | 50 × 50 |
| **Obstacles** | 18 (fixed, seed = 42) | 175 (fixed, seed = 42) |
| **Free cells** | 238 | 2,325 |
| **Malicious robot** | Always Robot ID = 0 | Always Robot ID = 0 |
| **Robot counts** | 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 | 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500 |
| **Iterations per configuration** | 25 (seeds 1–25) | 25 (seeds 1–25) |
| **Max steps per simulation** | Default (≈500) | Default (≈3000) |
| **Total runs** | 8 × 25 = 200 | 10 × 25 = 250 |
| **Grand total** | **450 simulations** |

Each configuration uses fixed obstacle placement and variable robot placements (via random seeds).

## 🧠 Data Output Overview

The script generates two detailed CSV files:

1. **`detailed_results_16x16.csv`** — results for 16×16 grid  
2. **`detailed_results_50x50.csv`** — results for 50×50 grid  

Each row in these CSVs corresponds to one full simulation run.

## 🧩 Column Names and Descriptions

| Column Name | Type | Description |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| **`grid_size`** | `int` | Size of the grid (16 or 50). |
| **`num_robots`** | `int` | Number of robots used in the simulation. |
| **`seed`** | `int` | Random seed for robot placement (1–25). |
| **`time_taken`** | `int` | Total number of simulation steps until termination or global coverage. |
| **`total_steps`** | `int` | Same as `time_taken` (alias for compatibility). |
| **`coverage_pct`** | `float` | Percentage of total free cells successfully covered by all robots. |
| **`completeness`** | `str` | `"Y"` if coverage ≥ 99.9%, otherwise `"N"`. |
| **`collisions`** | `int` | Total number of collisions recorded among robots. |
| **`frozen_robots`** | `int` | Number of robots that became frozen (`stop_in_place=True`) due to overlap or failure. |
| **`robots_completed`** | `int` | 
| **`overlap_area`** | `int` | Total number of re-explored (overlapping) cells during exploration. |
| **`avg_cells_per_robot`** | `float` | Average number of unique cells covered by each robot. |
| **`avg_path_per_robot`** | `float` | Average total movement steps (path length) per robot. |
| **`total_coverage`** | `int` | Total number of unique free cells covered collectively (union of all robots' coverage). |
| **`area_R1`** | `int` | Number of cells covered by Robot 1. |
| **`area_R2`** | `int` | Number of cells covered by Robot 2. |
| **`area_R3`** | `int` | Number of cells covered by Robot 3. |
| ... | ... | ... |
| **`area_Rn`** | `int` | Number of cells covered by Robot *n*, where *n = num_robots*. |

> The number of per-robot columns (`area_R1` → `area_Rn`) depends on the test configuration:
> - For 16×16 grid: up to **area_R40**
> - For 50×50 grid: up to **area_R500**

## 📈 Key Derived Metrics (Calculated in Script)

| Metric | Formula | Explanation |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Coverage %** | `(total_coverage / total_free_cells) × 100` | Measures overall exploration completeness. |
| **Robots Completed** | `max(1, min(num_robots, num_robots - (frozen_robots + collisions)))` | Ensures no negative or invalid values. |
| **Average Cells / Robot** | `Σ(area_Ri) / num_robots` | Workload efficiency. |
| **Average Path / Robot** | `Σ(path_length_i) / num_robots` | Travel effort per robot. |
| **Overlap Area** | Number of cells revisited by multiple robots | Indicates redundancy. |
| **Frozen Robots** | Robots that stopped due to collision, overlap, or malicious interference | Indicates resilience. |

## 📂 File Outputs

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **`detailed_results_16x16.csv`** | Metrics for 16×16 grid (5–40 robots, 25 seeds each). |
| **`detailed_results_50x50.csv`** | Metrics for 50×50 grid (50–500 robots, 25 seeds each). |

Both CSVs are automatically created in the **current working directory** after the script completes.
